# OpenGlRenderer2D

The project I was making while trying to learn openGl.

Currently available features:
  1) Rendering basic primitives like: Rectangles, Circles, Triangles, Lines;
  2) Rendering sprites, images to which can be easily loaded through Texture class;
  3) Camera that can be moved, scaled and rotated;
  4) All objects can be moved, scaled and rotated.

Planned features:
  1) Text rendering;
  2) Batching optimization.
